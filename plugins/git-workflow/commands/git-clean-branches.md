description: Clean up git branches marked as [gone]

Cleans up all git branches marked as [gone] (branches deleted on remote but still exist locally), including removing associated worktrees.

## Your task

Execute these commands to clean up stale local branches:

1. List branches to identify any with [gone] status:
```bash
git branch -v
```

Note: Branches with a '+' prefix have associated worktrees.

2. Identify worktrees for [gone] branches:
```bash
git worktree list
```

3. Remove worktrees and delete [gone] branches:
```bash
git branch -v | grep '\[gone\]' | sed 's/^[+* ]//' | awk '{print $1}' | while read branch; do
  echo "Processing branch: $branch"
  worktree=$(git worktree list | grep "\\[$branch\\]" | awk '{print $1}')
  if [ ! -z "$worktree" ] && [ "$worktree" != "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" ]; then
    echo " Removing worktree: $worktree"
    git worktree remove --force "$worktree"
  fi
  echo " Deleting branch: $branch"
  git branch -D "$branch"
done
```

If no branches are marked as [gone], report that no cleanup was needed.
